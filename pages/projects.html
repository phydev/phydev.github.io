<h2> // Big Data for Quality of Life (BD4QoL)</h2>
  <p>Head and neck cancer can significantly affect the quality of life for survivors. The <a href="www.bd4qol.eu">BD4QoL</a> is an Horizon 2020 project funded by the European Union. We developed clinical prediction models to help clinicians identify high-risk patients and offer personalized support. We deployed the models with FastAPI and a <a href="https://ocbe-uio.github.io/bd4predict/" target="_blank">dashboard</a>. The data used for model development and validation were obtained by a multinational effort with data providers from Italy, Germany, and the United Kingdom.</p>

<h2> // Supporting Personalised Treatment Decisions in Head and Neck Cancer through Big Data (SuPerTreat) </h2>
In this EraPerMed funded project we developed survival models for head and neck cancer patients based on gene signatures derived from gene expression data. The models were deployed with FlaskAPI and a Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS). The data used in this project were obtained from Italy, France, and Germany.

<h2> // Cellular Motility and Tissue Invasion </h2>
<p> The malignancy of a solid tumor is directly correlated with its metastatic potential. The process of metastasis formation begins by the movement 
  of a single cell when it emerges from tumor colony. This cell crosses the basement membrane penetrating a blood vessel and enters in the bloodstream. 
  Physics is more and more present in the research of cellular mechanics, particularly in the study of processes related with tumor growth. 
  In this project we will use continuous media and soft matter physics to model tissue invasion by metastatic cell in a quantitative way.

<h2> // Angiogenesis </h2>
 <p>
   Angiogenesis, or growing blood vessels,  is an important biological phenomenon responsible for many pathologies and has been an intensive 
   target of research in the last years. Despite of this, the knowledge about tumour induced angiogenesis still is a challenging problem 
   with relevant consequences for diagnosis and treatment of cancer. In this project we used a multidisciplinary approach, combining soft 
   matter physics theory with mathematical modelling, biology, biomedical engineering, among others. </p>
